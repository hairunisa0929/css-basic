      <p>
        The short-haired gray cat is recognized as belonging to Madura island,
        East Java. The Busok cat received global recognition as a native breed
        of Madura, East Java, by the World Cat Federation (WCF), an
        international association of cat clubs, on Nov. 10.

        The Madura-native cat is also known to have a short tail that resembles
        a pom-pom; the tail is famously known as a bobtail. The facial
        expression of the Busok cat resembles a leopard and a wild cat. The top
        of its face is somewhat rectangular, with a slightly pointy chin. Its
        ears are pointed and sticking out upwards. This article was published in

        recognition".
